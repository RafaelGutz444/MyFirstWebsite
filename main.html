<p>I used the DuckDuckGo search engine on the Firefox browser. I like using those two services better than google or anything else because of their priority of user privacy, 
whereas google will take user data indiscriminately. I am interested in software development in general. My attraction to it comes from the fact that programming is applicable 
to almost every field. I have a background and physics and so at the very least will strengthen my skills for research positions because programming is very useful for designing 
experiments and equipment. However, I think I want to work in the field of app development or automation. Part of the allure of working in tech industry is that the field is full 
of young people like me, jobs pay well, remote work opportunities, and wide job availability anywhere you could want to live.</p>

<p>The first job is DevOps Engineer (remote) at a company called Club Automation here in Chicago. The job is to help third-party party tools in finding processes that can be made 
seamless and automated. The role is general problem solving and optimization of the third-party software. Requirements include a bachelors in a technical field, understanding of Linux,
 networking, and internet principles, experience with automation tools, scripting (bash, powershell, Ruby, Python, Perl), 4+ years of work experience in IT or software development. 
Preferred skills include work with virtualization/ cloud technologies, understanding of internet technologies, and experience with open source technologies. Pay scales was not 
discussed in the job posting.</p>

<p>Seeing that my desired positions are alike to these, tells me I need to continue to learn about networking, further explore automation tools, and if I want to branch to another 
position of more purely software development, then Iâ€™ll need to also develop strong programming skills in a couple languages to diversify my applicability skills. One thing I could 
definitely do on my own is small side projects where I can begin to learn those skills. 
My question is that I plan to pursue a CS masters at my university I graduated from (Lewis University) and so my concern would be which classes I need to give me a solid foundation 
in skills that I need to develop, that I listed above. </p>
